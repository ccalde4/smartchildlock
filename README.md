At this point in time, the web application has not been fully integrated into the system as a whole. As such, 
the web application is a separate file from the smartlocks control script. 

To view the web application: 
Navigate into the webapp folder and double click the test.py file (you must have python3 installed).
Then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.

The Alexa skill will only work on my personal development account due to restrictions Amazon has in place
until a skill is published.
